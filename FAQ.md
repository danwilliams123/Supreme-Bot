#### How do I install the bot?

See the [README](README.md) for instructions. 


#### I get a "CRX_MAGIC_NUMBER_INVALID" error. What does that mean?

This is a problem with Chrome on your end. Do the following...

1. Sign into Chrome (this is in "chrome://settings")
2. Exit and open Chrome and try to install again.
3. If that didn't work, reinstall Chrome, and try to install CRX file again. 
4. If that didn't work, contact me at supremeautocheckout@gmail.com


#### Can I buy multiple items while using the bot?

If you add items to your cart before enabling the bot, yes you can. In addition, you can disable Auto Checkout and when you add an item, keep shopping and then you'll have to eventually hit process payment when you're done. 


#### How do I buy the same item X times?

This feature is not implemented and as of right now, I don't have any plans on implementing it. This encourages the high amounts of reselling goods and it's something that I won't encourage.
